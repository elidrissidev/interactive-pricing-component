- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

### What I learned

This was my first time styling a native `input[type="range"]`, and it was not straightforward because of the different prefixes required for all browsers. This is also the first challenge I do with a PRO subscription, so I tried to make the implementation look as close as possible and I'm happy about the result!
